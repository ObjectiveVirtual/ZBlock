ZBlock is a simple desktop app for Windows that helps you block most annoying ADs you see on your browser.

# How does it work?

As you can see in the image above, ZBlock has a very oversimplified GUI for an easy use. There is a dedicated button for blocking ADs, backing up and restore hosts file.

ZBlock modifies your system hosts file by adding a lot of advertisement domains that the system must block once you click on block ADs. Unfortunaly this will also block legit websites that doen't have the purpose to infect your device by a ton of ADs that's why it is recommended to do not always let ZBlock backup and restore your hosts file, always back it up in a spare drive or folder so when a problem occurs, you can easly resolve it.

# How do I must backup my hosts file?
First of all, if you have ZBlock operating on your system, shut it down. Then open your File Explorer and paste this "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc" into your explorer. Copy the hosts file and paste it into yor desktop or on a spare drive.
